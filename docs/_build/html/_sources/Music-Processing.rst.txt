Music Signal Processing
=======================

Magenta
-------

This file contains the details of Music Signal Processing Experiments with
Magenta. Currently, I am divinding it into 2 parts

  * Reproduce the experiments for Western Music. There is a tutorial available
    for `Music Generation Using RNNs
    <https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/06/10/recurrent-neural-network-generation-tutorial/>`_
    As of now, the only thing that the system accepts is the `MIDI files 
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI>`_
  * Try to run the same experiments on Indian Music.


MIDI and Ardour
---------------

* Ardour tutorial is available `here <http://manual.ardour.org/toc/>`__ and
  `here <http://brunoruviaro.github.io/ardour4-tutorial/>`__
* Ardour is a professional digital workstation for working with audio and MIDI.
